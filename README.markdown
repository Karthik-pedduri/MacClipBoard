You can download the latest pre-built `.app` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/Karthik-pedduri/MacClipBoard/releases).

**Building from Source**  
To build and run MacClipBoard from its source code, you'll need Xcode installed on your macOS machine.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karthik-pedduri/MacClipBoard.git
   cd MacClipBoard
   ```
2. Open in Xcode:  
   Open the `MacClipBoard.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.

3. Build and Run:  
   Select your target (e.g., "MacClipBoard") and click the "Run" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) in Xcode. The application will compile and launch.

üí° **Usage**  
- **Launch the Application**: After launching, MacClipBoard will appear as a clipboard icon in your macOS menu bar.  
- **Copy Content**: Simply copy any text or image as you normally would (`Cmd + C`). MacClipBoard will automatically add it to your history.  
- **Access History**:  
  - Click the clipboard icon in the menu bar.  
  - Use the global shortcut (`Cmd + Option + V` by default).  
- **Paste from History**: In the history panel, click on any item to automatically paste it into your currently active application.  
- **Settings**: Access settings from the menu bar icon to customize the maximum number of history items and change the global shortcut.

üîí **Security & Privacy**  
MacClipBoard is designed with your privacy in mind.  
- **Completely Local**: All clipboard history data is stored only on your local machine. It is never transmitted to any external servers or third parties.  
- **No Data Collection**: The application does not collect any personal data or usage analytics.  
- **Open Source**: The source code is available for review, allowing you to verify its security and privacy practices.

**Important: Accessibility Permissions**  
MacClipBoard requires Accessibility Permissions to function correctly (to monitor clipboard changes and simulate paste actions). This permission is necessary for the app to interact with your system's clipboard and simulate keyboard presses for pasting.

Upon first launch, you may be prompted to grant these permissions. If not, or if you need to manually enable them:  
1. Go to **System Settings** (or **System Preferences**) > **Privacy & Security** > **Accessibility**.  
2. Find **MacClipBoard** in the list and enable the checkbox next to it.  
3. If **MacClipBoard** is not listed, you might need to drag the application from your Applications folder into this list.
